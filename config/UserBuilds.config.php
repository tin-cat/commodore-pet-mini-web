You can change the volume from outside, I made different changes to the 3D-models for that (bigger cut out and different hooks for the screen and changes for speakers, amplifier, on/off-switch and power-connector). It was so much fun building this tiny little PET, and it looks like my Original CBM 4032 from 1980 (which is still working, but missing it's front sticker). Another one is in the making to improve more of the 3D-printed parts (cutouts for the HDMI-connector in the housing). I painted it in RAL9001, which is a creme-white color (as you mentioned to do). Next thing is constructing and printing a \"CBM-styled\"-controller for the games with cherry MX switches. I'm hoping that somebody can create a good model of the floppy-drive! That would be awesome!"

So cute that I had to build another one for a friend &hellip; Hardest part is the display cable: building it with pins, connectors and thin cables is easy but boring work. I have decided to keep the 3D print raw appearance, but I didn't like the all black keyboard, so I painted it like a real 8032 PET, a good result, I think. I've also used a common barrel connector so I can use an old no-USB power supply. <blockquote>Max has contributed ideas to create printable keycaps for an astounding looking mini keyboard and a serial plaque that makes his PET Mini unique!</blockquote>"

My build turned out to be more difficult as I substituted the recommended display for a cheaper 2.8\" SPI display. I ended up using an older version of RetroPie, and a RPi3B. My kids and I decided keep the 3D printed appearance, but I'm going to paint the inside black to help retain the light leakage. I too tried Combian64, and was unsuccessful getting it to work with my TFT display.  I'm currently modifying it and hope to release a version, which I'm calling \"CommPi\", with a bunch of PET 2001/4032 software pre-installed."

I installed Retropie on the mini pet along with Vice, but I would love to get Combian 64 working on it with the TFT display. Maybe someday. I collect a lot of old computers, thereâ€™s so much nostalgia with these beautiful machines. The Pet is one of my favorites when it comes to looks. Thank you for making this project possible. Itâ€™s an excellent design!"
