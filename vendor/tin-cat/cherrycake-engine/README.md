### What is Cherrycake?

Cherrycake is a low level programming framework for developing modular, efficient and secure PHP web applications.

Unlike content management systems and fully-featured frameworks like AngularJS, React or Laravel, Cherrycake sits only as a foundation layer upon which you can build virtually any kind of application.

The aim of Cherrycake is to provide you with a methodology that feels comfortable, rational and easy to use while reaching only the fundamental structural layers of your application, so you keep complete freedom on the fun layers.

### Beta statement

Although Cherrycake is still under heavy development and it's considered to still be in a beta stage, it's functional and it's already running some public web applications without issues. It's still not recommended to use Cherrycake in critical, or data sensitive applications. Instead, you're encouraged to try it to see for yourself whether it meets your security and stability requisites, and to contribute your suggestions or improvements via the official git repositories.
