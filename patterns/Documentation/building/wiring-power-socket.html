    <h2>Wiring the power socket</h2>

    <p>
        Because the original Commodore PET has all its connections on the back, we'll re-route the power socket from the Raspberry Pi to the back of the case using a <a href="<?=$e->AffiliateLinks->getLink("USBExtender")?>" target="supplies">micro USB extender cable</a>. It also looks much cooler that way.
    </p>

    <ol class="isolated">
        <li data-title="1">Cut the USB extender cable around halfway and peel off both ends.</li>
        <li data-title="2">We only need the black and the red wires, so protect the other wires with electrical tape to avoid short circuits.</li>
        <li data-title="3">Solder both ends of the black wire together again and protect it. <a href="<?=$e->AffiliateLinks->getLink("ShrinkTube")?>" target="supplies">This is an excellent and elegant method</a> to protect exposed wires and avoid short circuits.</li>
        <li data-title="4">Solder the red wire ends to the contacts of the switch button. If your switch has three contacts, use the leftmost or rightmost two.</li>
    </ol>
