    <h2>3D printing the parts</h2>
    <p>
        Download the ZIP file containing the 3D models ready to be sliced:
    </p>

    <a class="file" href="">
        <div class="UiComponentIcon white download"></div>
        <div class="title">commodore-pet-mini-3d-models.zip</div>
    </a>

    <p>
        There are two STL files to print: One for the white parts and another for the black ones. Individual STL files for each piece are also provided in case you want to print it piece by piece, or your 3D printer bed is too small to fit all of them. Each piece in those files is oriented to optimize printing quality and minimize as much as possible the risk of a failed print. I recommend you to keep this orientation, and to add supports when slicing.
