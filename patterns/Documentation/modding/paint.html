    <h1>Paint it</h1>

    <p>
        Most white 3D printing filaments are not completely opaque, and I'm not convinced the original Commodore PET was completely white. Also, simulating the yellowing of the plastic over time is a nice detail.

        I didn't need to paint the black parts because they look black and opaque enough, but If you'd like to make your PET even more realistic, I recommend you to paint the white parts with spray paint.

        <li data-title="1">Sand the surfaces a little bit with a fine grain sand paper. Not only to smooth the 3D printed surface, but also to allow the paint to stick better.</li>
        <li data-title="2">Apply a thin layer of <?=$e->AffiliateLinks->getLink("PaintPrimer")?> and let it dry. 10 minutes should be enough.</li>
        <li data-title="3">Apply two to four thin color layers, let each layer dry for some minutes between applications. The color I found that better matches the "Computer from the 70's look" (including a little bit of yellowing) is <?=$e->AffiliateLinks->getLink("PaintIvory")?></li>
    </ol>
