    <h2>Paint it</h2>

    <p>
        Most white 3D printing filaments are not completely opaque, and I'm not convinced the original Commodore PET was completely white. Also, simulate the yellowing of the plastic over time is a nice detail.

        I didn't need to paint the black parts, they look black and opaque enough. But If you like to make your PET even more realistic, I recommend you to paint the white parts with spray paint.

        <li data-title="3">Apply two or three thin color layers each 10 minutes. The colors I found resemble better the "Computer from the 70's look" plus a little bit of yellowing are <a href="<?=$e->AffiliateLinks->getLink("PaintIvory")?>" target="supplies">Light Ivory with matte finish, like this one</a></li>
