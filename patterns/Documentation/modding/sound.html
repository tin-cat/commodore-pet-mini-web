    <h2>Add sound</h2>

    <p>
        The Commodore PET sounds beautifully -ahem-, so it would be a shame to leave your replica without a pair of stereo speakers. Grab one of this <a href="<?=SUPPLIES_LINK_AUDIO_AMPLIFIER?>" target="supplies">tiny audio amplifiers</a>, <a href="<?=SUPPLIES_LINK_SPEAKER?>" target="supplies">this speakers</a> and cannibalize the audio jack from <a href="<?=SUPPLIES_LINK_AUDIO_JACK?>" target="supplies">one of those audio cables</a> you might have around. A little more wiring and you should be good to go:
