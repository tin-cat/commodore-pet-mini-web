    <h2>Order part kits</h2>
    <p>
        Some of the components needed are difficult to find, and the recommended links to Amazon might not work for your country, or might not be available. This is why I'm thinking on providing you with complete component kits you could buy, so you get everything you need to build your Commodore PET Mini, with just one shipping fee, and just one shipment to wait for. You can print and paint the parts while it arrives!
    </p>
    <p>
        To determine whether it would be worth the effort to me, if you might be interested in buying one of the kits, please <a href="<?=ORDER_INTEREST_FORM_URL?>" target="orderIntentionForm">register your intention here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        With this information, I will make a decision and contact you back to let you know if the kits are finally available for sale, so you will be able to place your order if you decide so. I won't be using your email address for any other purpose.

    <h2>Pricing</h2>

    <p>
        Prices are approximate, they will be adjusted if/when the project to provide this kits for sale is finally confirmed. All prices include taxes. Shipping and import fees not included.
    </p>

    <p>
        Prices are set like this: I'm adding a 10% commission to the price of the parts as they're available to me via Amazon, eBay and similar sellers. I'm not considering buying huge quantities to get discounts as this will imply a much wider scope and time consuming task than I'm able to deliver. The main cost of the labour comes from wiring the ribbon cable, which is quite a laborious and delicate task. <i>Kit #1</i> has an added labour cost of 35€, <i>Kit #2</i> of 45€, <i>Kit #3</i> of 55€, <i>Kit #4</i> of 10€ and <i>Kit #5</i> of 65€. All kits have an added cost of 5€ for packaging. Finally, labour prices and part commissions have an added 21% VAT.
    </p>

    <h2>Shipping</h2>

    <p>
        Shipping to all european countries and most other countries including USA and Canada will be provided. The shipment pricing is not known yet, it will be a tracked shipment service and won't include any needed import fees if those apply for your contry when receiving shipments from Spain.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsibilities</h2>

    <p>
        Please be aware that this is not a commercial product, and it does not comes with any guarantee, nor do I take any responsibility regarding any harm that may be caused while using this electronics.
    </p>

    <h2>The limitations <sup>*</sup></h2>

    <p>
        Please be aware of the limitations and known flaws of the Commodore PET Mini, such as the background noise caused by the Raspberry Pi audio jack, and the low power warning that might appear in some cases, as described in the <a href="<?=$e->Actions->getAction("todo")->request->buildUrl()?>">To do section</a>
