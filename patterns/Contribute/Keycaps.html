	<h1>Keycap labels</h1>
	<h2>Contributed by <a href="/user-builds#0007" class="contributor">Massimo 'Max' Sernesi ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹</a></h2>

    <p>
        Max contributed his ideas on how to create and print little keycaps to make the keyboard of the PET Mini look awesome. He also suggested the creation of a serial number plaque that might be customized and mimics the real PET serial number plaques.
    </p>

	<p>
		His contributions and ideas finally made it into the official Commodore PET Mini plans, and the little keycap labels are now available to download and print as part of the <a href="<?= $e->Actions->getAction("documentationSubPage")->request->buildUrl(["parameterValues" => ["sectionName" => "building", "pageName" => "labels"]]) ?>">Commodore PET Mini files</a> download bundle.
